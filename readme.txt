Shows a plot of plot data lines sent to serial port. 

Install the following to run it:

Python 2.6 
pyserial
wx
matplotlib
numpy
pylab
SerCom (another repository of mine)
plotHelper (included)

To use 
edit SerCom to match the com port attributes

From the command line, simply run:

python plotSaver.py
python plotViewer.py


Note: Make sure you have your Arduino IDE Serial Monitor closed, or it will block 
other programs like this one from using the serial port.
